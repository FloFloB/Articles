# Résumé de l'article : 
A Very Short Introduction to CCG

In Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), elements like verbs are associated with a syntactic "category" which identifies them as functions 
and specifies the type and directionality of their arguments ad the type of their result.

We here use the "result leftmost" notation in which a rightward combining functor over a domain β into a range α are written α/β,
while the corresponding leftwardcombining functor is written α/β.α and β may themselves be function categories. For
example, a transitive verb is a function from (object) NPs into predicates—that is, into
functions from (subject) NPs into S:
(1) likes := (S\NP)/NP
(2) Forward Application: (>)
X=Y Y => X
(3) Backward Application: (<)
Y X \Y => X

The principle of Combinatory Transparency: The semantic interpretatio of the category resulting from a Combinatory rule is uniquely 
determined by the interpolation of the slash in a category as a mapping between two sets
