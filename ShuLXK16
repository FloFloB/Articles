Lifelong-RL: Lifelong Relaxation Labeling for Separating Entities and Aspects in Opinion Targets

Problem statement: Given a set of opinion targets T={t1, ..., tn} extracted from an opinion corpus d, we want toclassify each target
                   ti in T into one of the three classes, entity, aspect, or NIL,which are called class labels. NIL means that the target
                   neither an entity nor an aspect and is used because target extraction algorithms can make mistakes.

We employ the graph labelling algorithm, Relaxations Labeling (RL) which performs unsupervised belief propagation on a graph. In our case,
each target extracted from the given corpus d forms a graph node and each relation identified in d between two targets forms an edge.
We employ Lifelong Machine Learning (LML), to make a major improvement in isolation that just using a propagation method.

LML works as follows, the learner has performed a number learning tasks in the past and has retained the knowledge gained so far. In the 
new/current task, it makes use of the past knowledge to help current learning and problem solving. Since RL is unsupervised, we can assume
that the system has performed the same task on reviews of a large number of products/ domains. It has also saved all the graphs and 
classification results from these past domains in a Knowledge Bases (KB). It then exploits this past knowledge to help classification in 
the current task/domain.
We call this combined approach of Relaxation Labeling and Lifelong Machine Learning, Lifelong-Relaxation Labeling
